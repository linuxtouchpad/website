# Welcome!

If you've ever been frustrated with the touchpad experience on Linux and subsequently felt like taking a deep dive to fix it yourself, you're not alone! This guide exists to help you find kindred engineers, and the quickest possible path to efficacy in a complex software stack.

## How can I help?

Donate to the <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/gitclear">Linux Touchpad Like a MacBook Pro</a> fund. More than 120 people are chipping in monthly to hire community-sponsored engineers to methodically improve the software stack.

If you're a software engineer with experience in C, C++ or another systems language like Zig or Rust, come talk to us on the <a href="{{ site.ltp.forum_url }}">forum</a> or in <a href="{{ site.ltp.discord_url }}">Discord chat</a>. We'd love to hear about your passion project or touchpad quirk that you're interested in fixing.

## Who are some of the key people?

There are many generous people involved who've spent years making touchpad on the Linux possible. Today, there are a handful of <a href="{% link community.markdown %}">people</a> involved in maintaining and adding new features--Peter Hutterer, Bill Harding, Povilas Kanapickas, and Jos√© Exposito for example.
