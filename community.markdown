## Chat

There are currently two places where you can gather for chat on Linux touchpad-related software development, depending on your platform preference:

- IRC: #wayland on oftc
- Discord: <a href="{{ site.ltp.discord_url }}">invite link</a>

We've had some difficulty with Discord in the past. If you were automatically removed, please try joining the new server.


## Discussion Forum

While there are severl project-specific issue trackers where some discussion can take place, this discussion area is meant as a place where all aspects of linux touchpad development can be discussed:
